--------------------

From this data, we can observe that the user time's growth is proportional to
the number of rows defined. This makes sense because there is a proportional
amount of tasks per row. The real time grows depending on the amount of rows but
at a very slow state. This is because of the extra overhead of a larger binary
tree of tasks.
