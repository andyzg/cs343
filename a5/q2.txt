Deadlock is the state when one or more processes are waiting for an event that
will not occur.

In the case of this Dr Who scene, each Angel is being looked at by another
Angel. In order for an Angel to move, it must not be looked at by another Angel.
However, in order for an Angel to stop looking at another Angel, it needs to
not be looked at. This results in two events dependent on each other to happen
in order to occur.
