  time ./longjmp 11 120 14 14
  user   0m11.601s

  time ./a.out 11 120 14 14
  user   0m46.700s

With optimizations:
  time ./longjmp 11 120 14 14
  user   0m11.149s

  time ./a.out 11 120 14 14
  user   0m49.967s

Observations:
  With optimizations, longjmp becomes faster but a.out becomes slower.

Speculations:
  Longjmp is faster and try catch is slower with optimizations. The reason that
  try catch is slower is because setting/resetting a label on a try block
  entry/exit is expensive. By using setjmp/longjmp, we store the data externally
  only once so we don't have to repeat the operation many times.
