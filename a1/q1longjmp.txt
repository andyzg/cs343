  time ./longjmp 11 120 14 14
  user   0m11.601s

  time ./a.out 11 120 14 14
  user   0m46.700s

With optimizations:
  time ./longjmp 11 120 14 14
  user   0m11.149s

  time ./a.out 11 120 14 14
  user   0m49.967s

Observations:
  With optimizations, longjmp becomes faster but a.out becomes slower.

Speculations:
  Longjmp is faster and try catch is slower with optimizations. I suspect that
  longjmp becomes faster because it becomes more efficient with handling memory
  since the code is more explicit with what actions are to be taken.  For
  example, not allocating memory if not necessary. As for the
  try catch, it becomes less efficient, where it tries to optimize how jmp_buf
  is handled but may cause a slower runtime as a result.
